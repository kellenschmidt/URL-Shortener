# URL-Shortener-PHP

Take long URLs and compress them into short links which are easy to share, tweet, email!

Created entirely from scratch using PHP, HTML, and a MySQL database.

### Technologies used

Majority of code is contained in a three PHP files which utilize:
- Embedded HTML to render the view
- PHP's built-in GET and POST requests to get arguments from URL and send form data
- Commands from the mysqli library to interact with the database

Uses Apache's mod_rewrite and .htaccess functionality to rewrite URLs

### Deprecated
